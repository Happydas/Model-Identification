                Title: Neural Network for Model Identification from Noisy Spatio-temporal Data
                
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are one of the most popular forms of mathematical
models used to describe Spatio-temporal processes occurring in nature. Recently,
there has been a huge surge of interest in the machine learning community for the inference
of PDEs directly from observational data. In this work, we explore the popular
DeepMOD (Deep Learning-based Model Discovery) algorithm to discover partial
differential equations from noisy Spatio-temporal data-sets. In this regard, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of the DeepMOD algorithm for different choice
of hyper-parameters and produce achievability plots to study the consistency of the
algorithm for several sample sizes. Initially, some investigations have been targeted
to analyze dependencies on the number of iteration, sample-size, noise-levels, and
tuning parameters to enable consistent model recovery. We present numerical experiments
on 1D Burgers and 2D-Advection-Diffusion equations by adding Gaussian
noise for discovering the governing PDEs.
